# crypto

I tried to download massively a list of cryptocurrencies, by marketcap. Then computed a time series of optimal weigths given a mean-variance portfolio, taking time-frames of 90 periods. 

The idea is to find the points at which the profit of taking the new optimal weights is better than stay n-periods more with the old optimal weights.
